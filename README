Swarm Net Explorer
==================

Swarm is a network devices detector, based on libpcap and libnet.

Swarm sniff all ip protocol packets that arrive to some network interface,
and register the ip addresses of hosts taking part on the communication.
Then, launches a bunch of custom-forged network packets, with the aim of
getting information about them. All information is stored in a MySQL database,
so it can be analyzed in a later time.

Currently, only ARP and ICMP protocols may be used to try to guess MAC address
and reachability from the device on which Swarm is launched.

As Swarm only can work with data arriving to a local network interface,
it's recommended to launch on a trunk interface of a switch, or to use some
technique which makes network traffic to flow through used interface (i.e.
MITM attack).

Note: Swarm is currently a proof of concept (PoC), and a project which main
purpose is to learn about network developing with C++.

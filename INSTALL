Compilation dependencies
========================

Be sure you have following packages installed on your system:

* libpcap-dev
* libnet-dev
* libmysqlclient-dev
* libconfig++-dev

Also, you will need a C++ compiler, we recommend GNU's, so install:

* g++


Installation instructions
=========================

Assuming you have downloaded source code in tar.gz compressed file. Follow this
steps to compile and install from source:

  tar -xvzf swarm-0.1.tar.gz
  cd swarm-0.1
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install

Configure database settings by editing swarm.conf file. Depending on how you
installed Swarm, it can be on /etc or on /usr/local/etc. You also have to
create an user account on MySQL server, a database, and give permissions to
user, so it can operate over the database.


Usage
=====

As swarm must read from, and write to, a network interface, it has to be
executed as root user (or be invoked as sudo). It's mandatory to state which
network interface it will use, so basic usage is:

  sudo swarm eth0

By default, swarm captures and processes only ip traffic. To get information
from some other network protocols, use this options:

  --arp   Capture and inject ARP packets
  --icmp  Capture and inject ICMP packets

More information about usage is available with --help option:

  sudo swarm --help

Version information available with --version option:

  sudo swarm --version
